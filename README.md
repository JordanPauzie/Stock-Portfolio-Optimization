Contains the coding portion of my final report for MATH 87 Mathematical Modeling. I utilized an integer linear programming model to optimize portfolio investment in the stock market for maximizing expected return. The model considers risk tolerance, expected dividends and sets limits on the quantity of capital investment and shares per company. In this project, the model was applied to optimize a potential portfolio investment in shares of technology companies in the United States of America. However, the general concept can be greatly expanded to model a broader scope of companies and industries.
